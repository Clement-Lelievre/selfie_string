# Side project based on [this article](https://datagenetics.com/blog/december12019/index.html)

Suppose you are given an image, a blank, white canvas, a black wound thread and an infinite amount of nails.
You pin how many nails as you wish in a circular fashion at the center of the image.
The goal is to try and reproduce as best as possible the image, using only the thread, from nail to nail.
